        Compute the block hash using a proof-of-work system.

        The proof-of-work system makes it progressively more difficult to perform the work required to create a new
        block. This means that someone who modifies a previous block would have to redo the work of the block and all
        of the blocks that follow it. The proof-of-work system requires scanning for a value that starts with a certain
        number of zero bits when hashed. This value is known as a nonce value. The number of leading zero bits is known
        as the difficulty. The average work required to create a block increases exponentially with the number of
        leading zero bits, and therefore, by increasing the difficulty with each new block, we can sufficiently prevent
        users from modifying previous blocks, since it is practically impossible to redo the following blocks and catch
        up to others.

        - Compute block hash H(blocks[i]) and cross-check with the recorded hash. Even if a single bit in a block is
          altered, the computed block hash would be entirely different.
        - Verify if H(blocks[i]) is correctly stored in next blockâ€™s previous_hash.
